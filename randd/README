I'm no professional cryptographer, so I cannot validate how good this program
is at providing "cryptographically good random". If you find one who is
willing to check it: tell me, he will be appreciated.

Docu
------

Take any webbrowser (eg. lynx or konqueror) and look into the doc directory.

Purpose
--------

This program was written to get a steady random source for several entropy
consuming processes, like GnuPG or SSL/TLS internet connections. Used at
higher speeds it should also be suitable for small statistic experiments (like
small versions of the Monte-Carlo-Test).

Credits
--------

This program was inspired by EGD (Entropy Gathering Daemon) from Brian Warner.
