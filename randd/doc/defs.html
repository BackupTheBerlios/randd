<h1>Definitions</h1>

<b>Random</b><br>
Are bits of random data collected in various ways. Refer to the
mathematical theories for details.<p>

<b>Random quality:</b><br>
Describes how random the random really is. A stream of numbers looking pretty
random to a normal human eye could be quite predictable for an expert.

<b>Random speed:</b><br>
Is the amount of random bits available per time. Normally measured in bits/second.<p>

<b>Entropy:</b><br>
(1) The amount of "real" random (unpredictability) per bit in a given set of
random bits. Measure for quality of random. (2) Synonymous for random.<p>

<b>Input stream:</b><br>
There are dozens of random sources on a common computer, all supported ones can be
configured as an input stream. However, their "quality" and "speed" differ widely.<p>

<b>Random source:</b><br>
For the purpose of this program input streams are combinable to raise the quality (entropy)
of the source.<p>

<b>Random output:</b><br>
Output methods for the gathered random. There are several different possibilities
and protocols for the random to be distributed.<p>

<b>Random/Entropy pool:</b><br>
Is a central storage area, where the random bits are collected until they can be sent
out.<p>
