<title>Randd: Configuration</title>
<body>
<h1>Configuration</h1>

The configuration is normally stored in <tt>/etc/randd.cfg</tt>, but can start
randd with a diferent file as a parameter.

The general format is:<br>
<tt>directive parameters...</tt><p>

Empty lines and lines starting with <tt>#</tt> are ignored.<p>

You should keep the general order of the sample config file and this description,
since the config file is parsed from top to bottom, if a reference cannot be
found when the parser goes over a line it will produce an error, even if the
reference is defined later in the file.

<h2>General Config</h2>

<tt>logmethod <i>method</i></tt><br>
the stream to write log messages to, method can be any of: stderr, stdout, syslog,
or file with an additional parameter with the file name.<p>

<tt>loglevel <i>level level...</i></tt><br>
Logging Levels to be written out:
<ul>
<li>error - error messages
<li>warning - warnings
<li>config - config file parsing (output is starting at this line)
<li>interface - interface open/close/config
<li>io - I/O messages
<li>debug - debug messages
<li>iodebug - I/O hex dumps
<li>default - default levels = error warning
<li>all - all loglevels are switched on
</ul>
Currently only error, warning, and debug are used.<p>

<tt>config <i>error|warning</i></tt><br>
defines whether the program should only warn or raise an error and exit if
it runs into an error in the config file.<p>

<tt>user <i>username/uid</i></tt><br>
Security: which user to switch to after configuration. (Currently not used.)<p>

<tt>daemon <i>yes|no</i></tt><br>
whether to go to background. <br>
Attention: this option interferes with loglevel, if it is still on stderr or stdout
it will be switched to syslog, if you switch to stderr or stdout afterwards you risk
writing trash on another file/device, since stderr/stdout are closed when daemonizing.<p>

<h2>Input Devices</h2>

All input devices follow this scheme:<br>
<tt>directive name bufferspace <i>options</i><br>
where <tt>name</tt> is a string identifiing this device (see source dirctive below) and
bufferspace is a number designating the space to use for an internal buffer, optionally
followed by "k" or "M" to multiply with 1024 or 1024^2.<p>

<tt>file <i>name bufspace filename</i></tt><br>
Any device file delivering some kind of random (eg. /dev/random).<p>

<tt>sound <i>name bufspace devicefile [options]</i></tt><br>
any sound device delivering some noise on its input channel (eg. /dev/sound/dsp0).
Options (currently ignored!) can be any of these (examples, preferred is first):
<ul>
<li><tt>allow-bits=<i>16,8</i></tt> - bit rates which are allowed
<li><tt>allow-speed=<i>48000,44100,32000,22100,11050</i></tt> - allowable sample rates
<li><tt>channel=<i>left|right|both</i></tt> - which channel to use
<li><tt>stereo=<i>yes|no</i></tt> - use stereo mode (default: try it)
<li><tt>bits=<i>2/16,1/8</i></tt> - how many bits to use in which bit-rate (default: 1 bit in any mode)
</ul><p>

<tt>inegd <i>name bufspace socket</i></tt><br>
<tt>inegdi <i>name bufspace host port [options?]</i></tt><br>
<tt>inegdi6 <i>name bufspace host port [options?]</i></tt><br>
local, TCP/IPv4, TCP/IPv6 Entropy Gathering Daemon. Currently only local works.<p>

<tt>prand <i>name bufspace [seedintervall]</i></tt><br>
Pseudo Random generator (rand()). Seedintervall is the amount of bytes to produce
without seeding the generator again. Currently the seed is taken from the entropy pool
it is planned to configure it to another device in order to make it more secure. However,
prand is only planned to be a xor-source for other devices (eg. sound cards).<p>

<h2>Entropy pool</h2>

<tt>source <i>maxlevel inputname [inputname...]</i></tt><br>
combines one or more input devices to one source for the entropy pool. Maxlevel is the
maximum fill level in percent of the pool to which to use this source, normally high
quality sources have the highest level (so that poor sources are only used in cases of
emergency). All input devices given in this statement are xor'ed together, so you will
each time get the amount of random data which is available in the input device with the
lowest fill grade of its internal buffer.<p>

<tt>persist <i>filename</i></tt><br>
filename to be used to store the entropy pool when shutting down and reading it back
when starting up again. Currently not implemented.<p>

<tt>poolsize <i>size</i></tt><br>
Size of the entropy pool in byte (optionally with suffix "k" or "M").<p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<tt>pipe <i>filename</i></tt><br>
Named pipe delivering pure random data without a special protocol (eg. can replace
/dev/random).<p>

<tt>socket <i>filename</i></tt><br>
Local Socket delivering pure random on all connections. Currently not implemented,
until problems with too big socket buffers solved.<p>

<tt>egd <i>file</i><br>
egdi <i>host port</i><br>
egdi6 <i>host port</i></tt><br>
Entropy Gathering Daemon compatible protocol on local, TCP/IPv4, TCP/IPv6 socket. Host
can be an asterisk (*) to bind on any interface otherwise it must be a local hostname or
IP-Address. Currently only local is supported.<p>
