<title>Randd: Sources of Random</title>
<body>
<h1>Sources of Random</h1>

<h2>Software Sources</h2>

These are also called Pseudo-Random-Generators. Computers can only create
predictable streams of bits following a certain formula to calculate them.
These streams of bits differ in quality in that the amount of values until
the stream repeats the same sequence differs.<p>

The predictability of a PRG can be raised by changing the so called "random
seed" from time to time. The random seed is a number (or more general a set of
bits) that is used to start the PRG with. By changing the seed the start point
of the sequence is changed. To make the seeding unpredictable the seed has to be
taken from a good random source (see hardware sources).<p>

Note 1: Some fellows say that their computer behaves unpredictable. But scientifically
this is a) pseudo-unpredictability in that the user does not know what to expect from
the computer, b) a formula too complex for or unknown to the user, or c) a hardware
fault.

<h2>Hardware Sources</h2>

<h3>Computer Clock</h3>

A clock (and especially a computer clock) is a highly predictable source of time
information. However the startup time of a program is often only slightly predictable,
so that the milliseconds part of the current time is often a good enough source of
random seed for a PRG.<p>

The system clock is used in cases of emergency for seeding the PRG of Randd. This is
when it is time to seed the PRG and no entropy is left in the pool.

<h3>Processor internal random source</h3>

Intel and others have integrated noise diodes into their processors and deliver
the created random bits to the user space via a special command or register.<p>

This source is currently unsupported.

<h3>Sound card</h3>

Analog lines tend to produce some high frequency noise in cables and connectors.
The analog to digital converters of sound cards sample the noise of the analog line.
Thus the least significant ("most silent") bits of a sound cards microphone or AUX line
can be used to collect some bits of random.<p>

This is currently one of the preferred methods.

<h3>Dedicated Random Hardware</h3>

There are several methods of integrating noise diodes or similiar devices into
computer hardware. Very common are devices that connect to the serial or parallel
I/O port. Cards that connect to the ISA or PCI bus are faster but also much more
expensive.

<h2>Combined sources</h2>

<h3>System activity</h3>

Is a combination of Hardware, Software and Human interaction. In everything that
is done with hardware at a computer there is some physical delay with few unpredictable
parts (eg. the time between keystrokes or the time between network packets). Some
kernels (eg. Linux) collect this unpredictability and give it back to the user.<p>

The kernel filters the most random bits out of this activity, so the bit stream can
usually be viewed as a nearly perfect source of random. Unfortunatly it is very slow:
/dev/random of Linux deliveres about 40 bytes per second.

<h3>PRG/Hardware combinations</h3>

There are several combinations where the speed of PRGs is combined with the high
quality of hardware. Eg. /dev/urandom of Linux is a PRG that is very often seeded by
/dev/random.


<h2>Speed and Quality</h2>

Here some examples.<p>

<table frame="1" border="1">
<tr><td>Source<td>Speed<td>Quality
<tr><td>rand (1)<td>11MB/s<td>very low
<tr><td>/dev/urandom<td>50kB/s<td>mid level
<tr><td>/dev/random<td>40byte/s<td>very high
<tr><td>sound card (2)<td>6kB/s<td>high-very high(3)
</table><p>

(1) Measured on my Bi-Athlon 1500+. Using only one byte per value.<p>
(2) Sound Blaster Live, 48kHz, one bit per sample.<p>
(3) The actual quality of this bit stream depends on the sound card. Mid range
sound cards have additional noise filters at the A/D converters, so the entropy can
be very low. Very high and very low quality cards don't have this filter and are
a good source of random. On good cards the best results are seen when the microphone
port is used and no microphone is connected or the microphone listens to the fan at the
power supply of the computer.<p>

Only very high quality sources should be used to feed cryptographic programs. Elsewise
you risk that your communication can be hijacked.<p>

Hardware sources tend to scew a little bit in favour of 0's or 1's or combinations
thereof. The quality can be raised by combining them with another source. Eg. a soundcard
with /dev/urandom.

<h2>Estimating costs</h2>

Depending on what you want to do you have to estimate what speed and quality you need.
This section tries to give some hints (DISCLAIMER: I'm no cryptographer, the likelihood
that I miscalculated something is high):<p>

Single-user-at-a-time-host with generation of gpg/ssl keys, and frequent
eMail-signing/-encrypting:<br>
normally there is no need to set up a random server, the speed of /dev/random
is high enough for signing/encryption, and normally generating a key needs only
few minutes.<p>

Single-user-at-a-time-host with impatient user:<br>
A few kB of entropy should be enough to satisfy any needs, the random can be
selected through /dev/random, it will deliver enough random for every day use.<p>

Multi-user-host with these apps:<br>
Todays servers support only few dozens of users, so there is no need to trick
around with special hardware or something, the above solution will suffice.
Maybe the entropy pool should be increased to half a megabyte.<p>

Secure Web-Server:<br>
(that's what I wrote this program for) Depending on traffic you can either stay
with a big entropy pool (1-2MB) and /dev/random or you might need something more.
It is important that your random source is of high quality. However, a sound card
or a serial device should easily deliver enough random for you. For example a
simple 44100Hz device will deliver 44100 bit per second, a SSL-Server needs about
128 bit per session (more if the connection stays for a longer time, which is
normally not the case for Web-servers), so this random source could deliver enough
random for approx. 340 connection establishments per <i>second</i> if every connection
stays up for 10 seconds that would mean your server could handle 3400 sessions at
the same time. You would need a gigantic amounts of processing power to handle
so many requests even in an unencrypted environment.<p>

Statistical Simulations (like Monte-Carlo):<br>
Depending on the amount of non-random work (ie. calculation) in these simulations
you might need quite some speed. For the normal simulations done by students and
most normal simulations high quality does not matter, in these cases you can easily
depend on the rand()-function. If you need a slightly higher quality either seed it
from the milliseconds of your starting time or values read from /dev/random. More
complicated tasks might require /dev/urandom. Only few projects need high quality
random, in most cases the sound card driver of randd will suffice, otherwise you will
need a cluster anyway so the costs of special random hardware won't be that big
in your quite huge purchase order.<p>
