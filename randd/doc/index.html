<h1>RandD - Random Daemon</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

This program was written to get a steady random source for several entropy
consuming processes, like GnuPG or SSL/TLS internet connections. Used at
higher speeds it should also be suitable for small statistic experiments (like
small versions of the Monte-Carlo-Test).


<h2>Usage</h2>

Randd is highly configurable. You can define different sources of random which
are used depending on the fill grade of the entropy buffer.
